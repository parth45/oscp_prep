Active Directory (AD), is a service that allows system administrators to update and manage operating systems, applications, users, and data access on a large scale.

system administrators often organize these objects into Organizational Units (OUs)

> One or more DCs act as the hub and core of the domain, storing all OUs, objects, and their attributes. Since the DC is such a central domain component, we'll pay close attention to it as we enumerate AD.
> 

Members of Domain Admins3 are among the most privileged objects in the domain.
